 In order to connect remotely to the remote desktop, on the terminal type in the code:
 ## ssh cs15lfa22mf@ieng6.ucsd.edu
 Afterwards, you should be prompted to input a password. This password should be the same one as the one your UCSD password
 
 *Note: This personally took a while due to waiting for the password to reset.*
 The terminal should look like this:
